# Students Performance Factors
## Description
This project explores various factors influencing student performance in schools, analyzing data related to gender distribution, previous and current exam scores, teacher quality, tutoring sessions, internet access, parental involvement, and other socioeconomic and logistical aspects. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships to understand how these factors contribute to academic success.
## Project Objective
1.	To find how the various factors that affects on students performance. Evaluate the distribution of male and female students across public and private schools.
2.	Compare scores from previous and current exams to identify changes or trends in performance.
3.	Understand the correlation between teacher quality and the number of tutor sessions attended.
4.	Analyze how internet access and available resources influence attendance and overall performance in private and public schools.
5.	 Investigate the relationship between parental involvement, study hours, and motivation levels of students.
6.	Examine how factors like distance from school, parental education, and peer influence affect student behavior and academic outcomes.
7.	Identify actionable insights to enhance student performance based on the analysis.

## Questions (KPIs)
•	Comparison between previous exam scores and current exam scores.
•	What are the total count of private and public schools?
•	What is the total count of male and female?
•	Does teacher quality reality affects on number of tutor sessions?
•	Relation between extra curricular activities and sleeping hours.
•	Which categories students has maximum and minimum access of resources based on there attendance?
•	Does parent education and motivation level is really affective? And How?
•	How parents involvement affects on students study hours? and Which category of parental involvement is high or low?

## Process
-	Verify data for any missing values and anomalies and sort out the same.
-	Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
-	Created pivot tables according to questions asked.
-	Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insight
-	Delivered 10+ actionable insights, including:
- Recommendations to increase internet access for ~30% of private school students without connectivity.
-	Strategies to train low-quality teachers, potentially increasing tutoring session participation by 3x (from 463 to ~1400).
- Addressing the ~20% gender disparity in private and public schools.

## Impact:
-	Provided actionable recommendations to improve student outcomes, potentially reducing the exam score decline by 15%-20% through targeted strategies.
-	Developed a reusable dashboard for school administrators, enhancing decision-making efficiency by up to 40% (e.g., tracking performance, attendance, and resource access).
